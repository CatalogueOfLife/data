# Datasource repository for CoL+
Repository for CoL+ datasets in DwC archive or ACEF format. 

## ACEF
The ACEF datasets (The CoL Annual Checklist Exchange Format) are all current [CoL datasources](http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/info/databases) exported directly from the CoL assembly database.
They are therefore already edited, but compared to the DwC-A files miss generated artefacts like genera.

## DWCA
The DWCA folder contains Darwin Core Archives of the CoL datasources exported via the CoL download service from the CoL production database.
