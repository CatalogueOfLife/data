title: Catalogue of Life Checklist 
version: "{date,yyyy-MM-dd}"
description: |
  The Catalogue of Life Checklist is a programmatically extended version of the COL Base Checklist from {date,yy.M}.
  It merges in additional names and other information from several often non global resources 
  with the aim to increase the coverage of names, include very recently published names and fill gaps in the COL Base checklist.
  For this taxonomic treatments present in Plazis Treatmentbank and various Pensoft journals that publish to ChecklistBank are included.

# List of regular expression patterns for scientific names that are globally blocked from any source.
# Patterns are case insensitive and must not be anchored at the front. Any match will block the name.
# Because of how YAML treats backslashes in double-quoted strings, note that all backslashes in a regex expression must be escaped when using double quotes. 
# For example, all of these are valid:
#   expression: \w*
#   expression: '\w*'
#   expression: "\\w*"
# Best to avoid using double quotes!
blockedNamePatterns:
 - '^\? [a-z]+'
 # unwanted patters from NCBI
 - '(?i)\benvironmental sample\b'
 - '(?i)\bunidentified\b'
 - '(?i)\buncultured\b'
 # unwanted group names from zoobank
 - '.*\grp\..*'
