In addition to the data contributed to the Catalogue of Life, the original FishBase database also includes descriptive, biological, ecological, physiological and conservation data and more, and onward links to information in many other databases. Data entry and maintenance is done mainly at the FishBase Information and Research Group, Inc. (FIN) in the Philippines since the 1st January 2011 in collaboration with many colleagues and institutions around the world. The team was previously hosted in WorldFish since the start in 1990 (formerly ICLARM then called WorldFish Center between 2001-2013, and now WorldFish since 2013). FishBase is supported by a Consortium of nine institutions around the world that acts as the Scientific Committee for FIN.  FishBase is funded mainly by the European Commission, and by several other donors. FishBase uses data and information from the Catalog of Fishes (CofF) developed by W.N. Eschmeyer at the California Academy of Science. In particular, FishBase uses CofF as the most complete and up-to-date fish nomenclator, and as a taxonomic authority list in a collaborative work of synchronization of the two databases.	Global

fungus-root) are mutualistic association of fungi with plant roots and the vast majority of plant species (probably >95%) are associated with mycorrhizal fungi; strictly speaking, plants do not have roots, they have mycorrhiza. The most widely distributed mycorrhizal 'type', both through the plant kingdom (formed by about 80% of all vascular plants) and geographically, is an endomycorrhiza formed by the Glomeromycota and called arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). In this, hyphae colonize plant cells and produce finely branched structures (the arbuscules). This symbiosis feeds most land plants, the arbuscules facilitating nutrient exchange and water uptake and, by carbohydrate transport to the soil, also represent a relevant terrestrial carbon sink.

Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Richmond, UK	DW Minter	Jan 2016	2016-01-22	The Rhytismatales, commonly referred to as ‘tar-spot’ fungi, are facultatively biotrophic, necrotrophic or saprobic on leaves and bark, sometimes also fruits, seeds and wood, frequently beginning as symptomless endobionts, later fruiting when the substratum has died. Those causing economic damage as needle diseases in conifers are the least poorly known. Their positive value as nutrient recyclers, and their possible protective role as endobionts is almost completely unevaluated. Most records are from the north temperate to subarctic zones, or from southern South America and Australasia; many collections are on conifers, the Ericaceae and Gramineae. Some species are widespread and plurivorous; others highly host-specific and limited in distribution.	Global

Hagborg, 	Jan 2017	2017-01-17	The Early Land Plants Today (ELPT) project aims to combine existing data on nomenclature, taxonomy and distribution for liverworts and hornworts. The project is jointly coordinated by Prof. Lars Söderström (Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway) and Anders Hagborg and Dr. Matt von Konrat (The Field Museum, Chicago, USA). This is an internationally coordinated effort involving over 40 bryologists from more than 16 countries. The data presented here is based on the first-ever worldwide checklist for liverworts (Marchantiophyta) and hornworts (Anthocerotophyta) published in 2016 and some recent updates after that. The checklist and the CoL data are derived from a working database centralizing nomenclature, taxonomy and geography on a global scale. As of January 2017 the database includes about 39,000 names of about 8,600 ‘accepted’ taxa, a bibliography of more than 25,000 references and more than 700,000 distribution records. The data includes all extant taxa for liverworts and hornworts and macrofossils closely related to them.  Prior to this effort a lack of centralization was a major impediment for the study and analysis of species richness, conservation and systematic research at both regional and global scales. The checklist as well as a list of contributors can be accessed at <a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.59.6261" target="_blank">doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.59.6261</a>.

The data is made available for other international databasing and conservation initiatives. This effort has been partially funded over the past several years by a variety of institutions and agencies including the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, The Field Museum, GBIF and the National Science Foundation.

The database currently contains data from "Psocoptera (Insecta): World Catalogue and Bibliography" by Lienhard and Smithers 2002. Updates for Psocoptera are in the process of being added. Data from major Phthiraptera catalogs will be added at a later date, together with host associations. When completed this database will house data from over 10,000 valid species and associated data.

Museum für Naturkunde  Leibniz Institute for Research on Evolution and Biodiversity	Neuhaus, B. .	2017-08-01	2017-08-01	Kinorhyncha (= Echinodera) is a taxon of marine animals ranging in size from 0.13-1.04 mm body length. The animals live in muddy to sandy sediments or appear on algae and invertebrates from the intertidal zone to the deep sea. Kinorhyncha feeds on bacteria, algae, diatoms, and detritus. Some 200+ species have been described  based on descriptions from adult stages plus 50 species based on the description from juvenile stages. Species known only from juvenile stages are generally regarded as nomina dubia, but names are available and valid according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The species are grouped in two subtaxa, namely Cyclorhagida and Homalorhagida. Further subdivision is in 22 genera using as distinguishing characters a) habitus, b) arrangement, shape and surface structure of cuticular plates, c) size, shape and arrangement of inner and outer oral styles as well as of scalids, and d) size, shape and distribution of spines, sensory spots, gland cell outlets and papillae.

University of Maine	Tyler, S.; Artois, T. .	2017-08-01	2017-08-01	Small ciliated worms known as acoels and nemertodermatids comprise the Acoelomorpha. Their position among other bilaterian animals is not clear, but a recent genomic study (Phillipe et al., 2011) placed them within the Deuterostomia, in a phylum Xenacoelomorpha that includes also the enigmatic sack-like animal Xenoturbella). Xenacoelomorpha is placed as sister group to the Ambulacraria (Echinodermata + Hemichordata). Earlier proposals that Acoelomorpha was the most primitive bilaterian group are likely to be a result of a statistical error known as long-branch attraction.   Relationships of species within the Acoelomorpha are no less certain. Their relatively simple morphology offers few characters to determine relationships and still too few of them have been examined for significant molecular-sequence data. Especially the smaller and probably more primitive species living in sediments are little studied; more is known of the more derived and larger acoels such as the convolutids. The current framework from molecular-sequence data, reflected in the hierarchy shown in this database, comes from Jondelius et al. (2011)	Global

World Register of Marine Species	Hayward, B.W.; Le Coze, F.; Gross, O. .	2017-08-01	2017-08-01	This World Database of all species of Foraminifera ever described, is part of the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), a global initiative to provide a register of all marine organisms.  Foraminifera (‘hole bearers’) or forams for short, are a large phylum of amoeboid protozoans (single celled) with reticulating pseudopods, fine strands of cytoplasm that branch and merge to form a dynamic net. They usually produce a test (or shell) which can have one or more chambers, and are made of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or mineral grains or other particles glued together. The tests are usually less than 0.5 mm in size, but the largest can be up to 20 cm across. Foraminifera are among the most abundant and scientifically important groups of marine organisms. The tests of recently dead planktic foraminifera are so abundant that they form a thick blanket over one third of the surface of the Earth (as Globigerina ooze on the ocean floor). Foraminifera are essentially marine- and estuarine-dwelling protozoans living in all environments from the greatest depths right up to highest astronomical tide level and from the equator to the poles.    The importance of foraminifera comes from the use of their fossil tests in biostratigraphy, paleoenvironmental studies, and isotope geochemistry. Their ubiquity in most marine sedimentary rocks, often as large, well-preserved, diverse assemblages, has resulted in their being the most studied group of fossils worldwide. Because modern foraminifera have attracted little interest from biologists, paleontologists have been forced to undertake most studies, including genetic research, on the living fauna.  This site has the following aims:      to provide a catalogue of the world's foraminiferal species      to promote stability in foraminiferal nomenclature      to act as a tool for higher taxonomic revisions and regional monographs	Global

Concerning the Recent non-marine  Ostracoda, very few of the 2,000 species and approximately 200 genera of are included in the present data, because they have already been compiled by Martens et al.

First, we include Platycopida within the subclass Platycopa, while Horne et al. (2002) place it within Podocopa. Second, we place the superfamily Puncioidea (which includes a few Recent species) directly in the subclass Palaeocopa, while Horne et al (2002) include it within Subclass Podocopa, order Palaeocopida and  Suborder Kirkbyocopina.

CoL Hierarchy Panel	Mike Ruggiero	2015	2015-04-29	"We present a consensus classification of life to embrace the more than 1.6 million species already provided by more than 3,000 taxonomists? expert opinions in a unified and coherent, hierarchically ranked system known as the Catalogue of Life (CoL). The intent of this collaborative effort is to provide a hierarchical classification serving not only the needs of the CoL's database providers but also the diverse public-domain user community, most of whom are familiar with the Linnaean conceptual system of ordering taxon relationships. This classification is neither phylogenetic nor evolutionary but instead represents a consensus view that accommodates taxonomic choices and practical compromises among diverse expert opinions, public usages, and conflicting evidence about the boundaries between taxa and the ranks of major taxa, including kingdoms. Certain key issues, some not fully resolved, are addressed in particular. Beyond its immediate use as a management tool for the CoL and ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System), it is immediately valuable as a reference for taxonomic and biodiversity research, as a tool for societal communication, and as a classificatory "backbone" for biodiversity databases, museum collections, libraries, and textbooks. Such a modern comprehensive hierarchy has not previously existed at this level of specificity." <i>PLoS ONE 10(4): e0119248. doi:10.1371/jou</i>	NULL
501	1501	 IRMNG: Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera	IRMNG	All genera	Rees T.	Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia.	Tony Rees	Jan 2014	2014-01-30	The Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) is a project of OBIS Australia designed to assist in the provision of marine species data to OBIS, by permitting the discrimination of marine from nonmarine (and extant from fossil) species records on the basis of the genus name portion of their scientific name (normally, genus + species, or genus + species + infraspecies if applicable). The aim of the project is to (a) assemble as complete a list as possible of the estimated 150,000 extant and 50,000 fossil generic names in current use, plus their possible further 250,000-300,000 synonyms, and (b) flag as many of these as is possible with their marine/nonmarine, and extant/fossil, status. Relevant species lists are also being attached to the "correct" instances of genus names as available.   	Global
